## Deployment

### Project Set-up
The recommended Code Institute template found [here](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) was used. This template was pre-configured with useful extensions and allowed me to get the project up and running quickly. I selected a repository name and used Gitpod to start editing my project files.

The Remote/Guide website was deployed to GitHub Pages by following these steps:
1. Navigate to the [Project 1 portfolio](https://github.com/neil314159/portfolio-project-2) on GitHub.
1. Click on the 'Settings' tab.
1. Select 'Pages' from the menu on the left. 
1. Select the 'main' branch in the source selector drop-down.
1. Click 'Save'.
1. After a few moments the website was deployed, and can be accessed here: https://neil314159.github.io/portfolio-project-2/
