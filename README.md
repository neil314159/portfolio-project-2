## Purpose

The

The site can be viewed [here](https://neil314159.github.io/portfolio-project-2/).

## Features

* Home Screen

### Features to implement in the future
* Currently the logic used by the computer player is quite simple. It is possible to calculate multiple moves ahead and choose the best option statistically, but this is quite taxing on the browser when done through CSS and Javascript. A different software framework may be required for handling these operations.
* Adding some sound effects and animations to the game would increase the level of interactivity.
* An online multiplayer option could be added to increase user engagement. This would require managing user accounts and networking protocols.

## Wireframes

## Technologies Used
* HTML 
    * The structure and contents of the website were created using the HTML language.
* CSS 
    * The CSS language was used for styling and layout of the site.

* HTML 
    * HTML was used to define the content and overall structure of the website.
* CSS 
    * CSS was used for styling the elements of the site, as well as for defining and manpilating 3D elements needed for the game.
* JavaScript
    * Javascript was used to create the layout and interactive elements of the game. This involved using event listeners to trigger actions, and manipulating the DOM to manage the state of the game.
* [Github](https://github.com) 
    * GitHub is used to store the source code of the site.
* [Git Pages](https://pages.github.com)
    * Git Pages was used to deploy the website.
* [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) 
    * Gitpod provided a remote development environment and was linked to Github to facilitate storage and deployment.
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
	* Google Fonts was used to browse a number of options and select the Sora font as being suitable for the project.
* [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/)
	* Balsamiq was used to explore initial designs for the site and develop wireframe models of the layout.
* [clrs.cc](https://clrs.cc)
    * This site provided a pallette of suitable colours for a modern website which were then adjusted for my project.
* [MacOS Preview](https://support.apple.com/guide/preview/welcome/mac)
    * MacOS Preview was used to generate and edit screenshots of the website.
* [Favicon](https://favicon.io/) 
    * Favicon.io was used to draw, edit and download a favicon ready to deploy to the site.
* [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse#devtools) 
    * Google Lighthouse generated a report which verified the performance and usability of the site. 
* [Google Chrome Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) 
    * Chrome Developer Tools were used to debug programming logic errors by logging variables to the console.
* [Wave Web Accessibility Tool](https://wave.webaim.org) 
    * The Wave Tool generated a report which highlighted potential areaas of concern for users with accessibilty concerns.
## Testing


* Test how responsive the website is on different browsers and screen sizes.
    * Test:
        1. Select a test suite of browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox).

### Validation Testing
* HTML: All pages in the site were tested

### Unfixed Bugs

No other bugs were found during my testing.


## Deployment

### Project Set-up
The recommended Code Institute template found [here](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) was used. This template was set up with a standard configuration for VSCode and Gitod which saved time and let me get started quickly. I chose a repository name and used Gitpod to create and edit my project files.

The Remote/Guide website was deployed to GitHub Pages by the folllowing actions:
1. Navigate to [Project 2 Portfolio](https://github.com/neil314159/portfolio-project-2) on GitHub.
1. Click on the 'Settings' tab.
1. Select 'Pages' from the menu on the left side of the page. 
1. Select the 'main' branch in the source selector drop-down.
1. Click 'Save'.
1. After a few minutes the website was deployed. The finished project can be found here: https://neil314159.github.io/portfolio-project-2/


## Credits

### Code

This [tutorial](https://3dtransforms.desandro.com/cube) on how to construct and rotate 3D cubes in CSS was used to understand some of the principles used in my project.
